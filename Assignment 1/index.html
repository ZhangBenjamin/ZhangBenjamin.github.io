<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>The term "United States," when used in the geographical sense, refers to the contiguous <br>
   United States (sometimes referred to as the Lower 48), the state of Alaska, the island <br>
   state of Hawaii, the five insular territories of Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, <br>
   U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and minor outlying possessions. The United <br>
   States shares land borders with Canada and Mexico and maritime borders with Russia, Cuba, <br>
   The Bahamas, and other countries, in addition to Canada and Mexico. The northern border of <br>
   the United States with Canada is the world's longest bi-national land border.</p>

<h3> General Characteristics </h3>
<pre>
The United States shares land borders with Canada (to the north) and Mexico 
(to the south),a territorial water border with Russia in the northwest, and 
two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and 
Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous forty-eight states are otherwise 
bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and 
the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the 
south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to 
the north, while Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific 
Ocean.

Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. 
This group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the contiguous 
United States, and as the Lower 48. Alaska, which is included in the term 
continental United States, is located at the northwestern end of North America.

The capital city, Washington, District of Columbia, is a federal district 
located on land donated by the state of Maryland. (Virginia had also donated land, 
but it was returned in 1849.) The United States also has overseas territories 
(Insular areas) with varying levels of autonomy and organization: the Caribbean 
territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (formerly the Danish Virgin 
Islands, purchased by the US at the beginning of WW2), and in the Pacific the 
inhabited territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, 
along with several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired 
were a part of United States imperialism, or to gain access to the east.

Nearly all of the United States is in the northern hemisphereâ€”the exceptions are 
American Samoa and Jarvis Island
