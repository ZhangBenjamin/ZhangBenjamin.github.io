<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>The term "United States," when used in the geographical sense, refers to the contiguous 
   United States (sometimes referred to as the Lower 48), the state of Alaska, the island 
   state of Hawaii, the five insular territories of Puerto Rico, Northern Mariana Islands, 
   U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and minor outlying possessions. The United 
   States shares land borders with Canada and Mexico and maritime borders with Russia, Cuba, 
   The Bahamas, and other countries, in addition to Canada and Mexico. The northern border of 
   the United States with Canada is the world's longest bi-national land border.</p>

The United States shares land borders with Canada (to the north) and Mexico 
(to the south),a territorial water border with Russia in the northwest, and 
two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and 
Florida and the Bahamas. The contiguous forty-eight states are otherwise 
bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and 
the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the 
south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to 
the north, while Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific 
Ocean.

Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. 
This group is referred to, with varying precision and formality, as the contiguous 
United States, and as the Lower 48. Alaska, which is included in the term 
continental United States, is located at the northwestern end of North America.

The capital city, Washington, District of Columbia, is a federal district 
located on land donated by the state of Maryland. (Virginia had also donated land, 
but it was returned in 1849.) The United States also has overseas territories 
(Insular areas) with varying levels of autonomy and organization: the Caribbean 
territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (formerly the Danish Virgin 
Islands, purchased by the US at the beginning of WW2), and in the Pacific the 
inhabited territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, 
along with several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired 
were a part of United States imperialism, or to gain access to the east.

Nearly all of the United States is in the northern hemisphere—the exceptions are 
American Samoa and Jarvis Island

<h3> Natural Disasters </h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Tornadoes</th>
        <th>According to a recent Gallup survey, around one in three Americans said that they directly experienced a severe weather condition over the previous two years.
        The Great Plains and Midwest, due to the contrasting air masses, see frequent severe thunderstorms and tornado outbreaks during spring and summer with around 
        1,000 tornadoes occurring each year. The strip of land from north Texas north to Kansas and Nebraska and east into Tennessee is known as Tornado Alley, 
        where many houses have tornado shelters and many towns have tornado sirens, due to the very frequent tornado formation in the region. </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Hurricanes</th>
        <th>Hurricanes are another natural disaster found in the US, which can hit anywhere along the Gulf Coast or the Atlantic Coast as well as Hawaii in the Pacific 
        Ocean. Particularly at risk are the central and southern Texas coasts, the area from southeastern Louisiana east to the Florida Panhandle, peninsular Florida, 
        and the Outer Banks of North Carolina, although any portion of the coast could be struck. The U.S. territories and possessions in the Caribbean, such as Puerto
        Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are also vulnerable to hurricanes due to their location in the Caribbean Sea. Hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, 
        with a peak from mid-August through early October. Some of the more devastating hurricanes have included the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Hurricane Andrew in 1992, 
        Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Maria in 2017. </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Flooding</th>
        <th>Occasional severe flooding is experienced in the United States. Significant floods throughout history include the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great 
        Flood of 1993, and widespread flooding and mudslides caused by the 1982–83 El Niño event in the western United States. Flooding is still prevalent, mostly on 
        the Eastern Coast, during hurricanes or other inclement weather, for example in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy devastated the region. Localized flooding can, however, 
        occur anywhere, and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of desert shrub in the west 
        can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas in the west and severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to flash floods 
        as well, which can sometimes be devastating, while nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can 
        occur almost anywhere). </th>

<h3> Area </h3>
<pre>
From 1989 through 1996, the total area of the US was listed as 9,372,610 km2 
(3,618,780 sq mi) (land + inland water only). The listed total area changed 
to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi) in 1997 (Great Lakes area and coastal 
waters added), to 9,631,418 km2 (3,718,711 sq mi) in 2004, to 9,631,420 
km2 (3,718,710 sq mi) in 2006, and to 9,826,630 km2 (3,794,080 sq mi) in 2007 
(territorial waters added).

<h3> Climate </h3>
<pre>
Due to its large size and wide range of geographic features, the United States 
contains examples of nearly every global climate. The climate is subtropical 
in the Southern United States, continental in the north, tropical in Hawaii 
and southern Florida, polar in Alaska, semiarid in the Great Plains west of 
the 100th meridian, Mediterranean in coastal California and arid in the Great 
Basin and the Southwest. Its comparatively favorable agricultural climate 
contributed (in part) to the country's rise as a world power, with infrequent 
severe drought in the major agricultural regions, a general lack of widespread 
flooding, and a mainly temperate climate that receives adequate precipitation.
